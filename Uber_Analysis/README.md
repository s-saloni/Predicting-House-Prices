# NYC Uber Data Analysis

### Data sets
The data sets utilized in this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). The 2014 files were combined to create one data set and the 2015 data set was already provided as one file.

The data sets were reduced to include data points from only April, May and June, which are the overlapping months included in both data sets. The data was further transformed for location analysis in order to plot coordinates and for datetime analysis in order to chart and cluster time data.

### Results
The jupyter notebooks in this section include various charts and maps that can give a more detailed look into some of our results. We have been able to determine peak times of rideshare usage as well as the most common locations where rideshares occur.
