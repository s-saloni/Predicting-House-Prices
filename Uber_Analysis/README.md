# NYC Uber Data Analysis

### Data sets
The data sets utilized in this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). The 2014 files were combined to create one data set and the 2015 data set was already provided as one file.

The data sets were reduced to include data points from only April, May and June, which are the overlapping months included in both data sets. The data was further transformed for location analysis and for datetime analysis.
